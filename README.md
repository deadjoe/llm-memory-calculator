## Memory Calculation Algorithm

The calculator uses a comprehensive algorithm to estimate memory requirements based on real-world usage patterns rather than theoretical minimums. Below is the detailed calculation methodology:

### Core Memory Components

1. **Base Model Size (GB)**:
   - Parameter Count (P) × Bytes per Parameter
   - Bytes per parameter varies by precision:
     - 32-bit (FP32): 4 bytes/parameter
     - 16-bit (FP16/BF16): 2 bytes/parameter
     - 8-bit Quantized: 1.2 bytes/parameter (includes quantization overhead)
     - 4-bit Quantized: 0.65 bytes/parameter (includes metadata overhead)

2. **Framework Overhead**:
   - 15% additional to base model size
   - Accounts for PyTorch/TensorFlow runtime memory allocation

3. **Operation Mode Multiplier**:
   - Inference: 1.05× multiplier (5% overhead)
   - Fine-tuning: 2.5× multiplier (150% overhead)
   - Training from Scratch: 4.0× multiplier (300% overhead)

4. **Inference-specific Components** (only applied in inference mode):
   - **KV Cache**:
     - KV Cache (GB) = (Num Layers × 2 × Hidden Size × Context Length × Bytes per Parameter) ÷ 10^9
     - Uses model-specific values for layers and hidden dimensions:
       - 7B models: 32 layers, 4096 hidden dimension
       - 13B models: 40 layers, 5120 hidden dimension
       - 34B models: 60 layers, 6656 hidden dimension
       - 70B models: 80 layers, 8192 hidden dimension
       - 175B+ models: 96 layers, 12288 hidden dimension
     - Uses 8192 as the default context length

   - **Activation Memory**:
     - Activation Memory (GB) = (Hidden Size × Context Length × Bytes per Parameter × 2) ÷ 10^9

5. **CUDA/Runtime Buffer**:
   - 8% of total memory allocation
   - Accounts for CUDA workspace and system buffers

6. **System Architecture Factor**:
   - PC/NVIDIA: 1.0× (standard)
   - Apple Silicon: 0.9× (unified memory efficiency)

7. **Hardware Recommendation Safety Margin**:
   - 10% additional buffer for recommendations
   - Ensures comfortable operation without memory pressure

### Complete Formula

For inference mode:
```
Memory (GB) = [(Base Model Size × 1.15 × 1.05) + KV Cache + Activation Memory + Buffer] × System Factor
```

For training/fine-tuning:
```
Memory (GB) = [(Base Model Size × 1.15 × Mode Factor) + Buffer] × System Factor
```

### Hardware Recommendations

The calculator accounts for actual usable VRAM in its recommendations by reserving:
- ~2-8GB for system/CUDA runtime on NVIDIA GPUs
- ~2-20GB for system needs on Apple Silicon (depending on total RAM)

## Development

The calculator is built with vanilla JavaScript and Three.js for visualizations. All computation happens client-side with no external API dependencies.

### Technologies Used

- HTML5 and CSS3 for layout and styling
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+) for calculations
- Three.js for 3D memory visualization
- KaTeX for formula rendering
- Tween.js for smooth animations
